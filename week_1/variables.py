# Name :

# Integer are positive / negative whole numbers

x = 10 
y = -24

# Float : decimal / floating point 
pi = 3.142

# Characters  : alphanumeric , 0-9 , A...Z a ...z
# special characters : ! # $ @ * , chinnese alphabet

grade = 'A' # use single quotation marks  


# strings : a group of characters

height = 20 
# print (height ) -->20
height = 20 * 2

# print (height ) -->40

#constansts --> dont change 

pi = 3.142 

# Avogadros constant
avogadrosConstant = 6.029 * (10 ** 23)

# planks constant

h = 6.62607015 * (10 ** (-34))
